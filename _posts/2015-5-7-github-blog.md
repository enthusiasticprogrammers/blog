With the unveiling of our website we decided to make this a community project! Head over to our
github at https://github.com/enthusiasticprogrammers and feel free to contribute and content.

Our Blog platform utilizes the static blog Jekyll interface so you can even blog for us!

We wrote our site using HTML/CSS, here's a good resource if you need to freshen up:

We're looking forward to improving the website to provide resources for students and the public.
